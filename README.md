> "It's [programming] the only job I can think of where I get to be both an engineer and an artist. There's an incredible, rigorous, technical element to it, which I like because you have to do very precise thinking. On the other hand, it has a wildly creative side where the boundaries of imagination are the only real limitation." - Andy Hertzfeld.

I started my career 10+ years ago. I started as a Full Stack engineer, working on projects for several industries and purposes, developing mobile (Android),  web (both frontend/backend, working with Java, Python (Django), Ruby (Ruby on Rails), and Javascript (NodeJS)) and desktop (Java Swing, yeah, I know... Â¯\\_(ãƒ„)\_/Â¯]) solutions, designed from scratch or in maintenance/evolution phase, working with local and remote teams, interfacing with the client when necessary to understand requests and needs,

During my earliest years as a Software Engineer, I got my MSc. degree, researching [privacy in Smart Cities](https://repositorio.ufpe.br/handle/123456789/14020). As one of my main contributions, I designed a metric to measure personal data exposure risk from a user perspective, together with an evaluation method based on storytelling and gamebooks, to test the metric's applicability.

I see myself as a curiosity-driven autodidact and a passionate learner.

In the last 6+ years, I've been focusing on web development's front-end side, and I'm sure I've found my passion. For me, it is fascinating to build code that represents a beautiful, pixel-perfect User Interface, keeping in mind a well-grounded User Experience. But don't get me wrong; it excites me as much [design|produc]ing off-screen code, playing with computing fundamentals (data structures, well-known algorithms...).
I easily fall in love with designing incredible software architectures (reusable, maintainable, easy to evolve building blocks, etc.), mainly when it involves a lot of learning in the process. That keeps me g[row]oing.

- _Iâ€™m currently working_ on my very own [React UI component library](https://github.com/cheesebit/ui) **just for fun**;
- Iâ€™m constantly strengthening my programming skills (it's amazing how you *always* learn something new!);
- I'm currently working on my [Algorithms and Data Structures Specializations](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-structures-algorithms), just because I love the subject.
