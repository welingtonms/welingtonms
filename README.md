> "It's [programming] the only job I can think of where I get to be both an engineer and an artist. There's an incredible, rigorous, technical element to it, which I like because you have to do very precise thinking. On the other hand, it has a wildly creative side where the boundaries of imagination are the only real limitation." - Andy Hertzfeld

I started my career 9+ years ago. During my earliest years as a Software Engineer I got my MSc. degree, researching [privacy in Smart Cities](https://repositorio.ufpe.br/handle/123456789/14020). As one of my main contributions I designed a metric to measure risk of personal data exposure from a user perspective, altogether with an evaluation method, based on storytelling and gamebook, to test the metricâ€™s applicability.

I see myself as a curiosity-driven autodidact and a passionate learner.

For me it is really exciting to build code that represents a beautiful User Interface, keeping in mind a well grounded User Experience. But don't get me wrong... It excites me as much [design|produc]ing off-screen code, playing with computing fundamentals (data structures, well known algorithms...).
I easily fall in love with designing awesome software architectures (reusable, maintainable, easy to evolve building blocks, etc.), mainly when it involves a lot of learning in the process, that keeps me g[row]oing.

- ðŸŒ±  Iâ€™m currently learning about User Experience and strengthening my Javascript skills (it's amazing how you *always* learn something new!).
