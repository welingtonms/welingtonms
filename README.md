> "It's [programming] the only job I can think of where I get to be both an engineer and an artist. There's an incredible, rigorous, technical element to it, which I like because you have to do very precise thinking. On the other hand, it has a wildly creative side where the boundaries of imagination are the only real limitation." - Andy Hertzfeld.

I started my career in 2011 as a Full-Stack engineer. Since then, I have worked on projects for several industries and purposes, developing mobile,  web, and desktop solutions designed from scratch or in the maintenance/evolution phase, working with local and remote teams.

During my earliest years as a Software Engineer, I got my MSc. degree, researching [privacy in Smart Cities](https://repositorio.ufpe.br/handle/123456789/14020). As one of my main contributions, I designed a metric to measure personal data exposure risk from a user perspective and an evaluation method based on storytelling and gamebooks to test the metric's applicability.

I consider learning a never-ending task that I take very seriously. Likewise, I seize every opportunity to mentor or share anything I know with my peers; this has been a valuable tool for consolidating everything I learned and, most importantly, for building connections.

I've been focusing on web development's front-end side in the last few years, and I'm sure I've found my passion. It is fascinating to build code that represents a beautiful User Interface, keeping in mind a well-grounded User Experience. But don't get me wrong; it excites me as much [design|produc]ing off-screen code, playing with computing fundamentals.
I easily fall in love with designing incredible software architectures, mainly when it involves a lot of learning in the process. That keeps me g[row]oing.
